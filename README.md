## Introduction
A restructured HTML template based on the Google Cloud Platform design style. This was done by obtaining Googles CSS code and going through the process of deobfuscating it, then creating a complete package of AngularJS transcluding elements of the complicated Google elements, into an easy to work with HTML template.

## Ease of Use
The code behind Googles platform is extremely complicated and most of it is obfuscated. However, after much trial and error the wrappers are very flexible and easy to use. An example of the markup needed for nCards.

## Roadmap

### Current Wrapper Elements
- Panels (nPanel directive)
- Cards (nCard directive)
- JFK Buttons (nBtn-primary/nBtn-secondary directive)
- Random Typography Directives
- Dialog (nDialog directive)
- Collapsing Sidebar (nSidebar directive)
- Input (nInput directive)
- Select (nSelect directive)

### In Development
- Tables
- Alerts
- More Flexible typography
- Full Form element support

## What now?

Currently I'm getting the code to a usable state, where everything is clean and ready for the first distribution. Once that's done, I'll release for future collaboration. NOTE: by using this code, you are violating copyrights by Google. This is for educational purposes only. 


(more to come!)
