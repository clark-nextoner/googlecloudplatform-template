## Introduction
A restructured HTML template based on the Google Cloud Platform design style. This was done by obtaining Googles CSS code and going through the process of deobfuscating it, then creating a complete package of AngularJS transcluding elements of the complicated Google elements, into an easy to work with HTML template.

## Ease of Use
The code behind Googles platform is extremely complicated and most of it is obfuscated. However, after much trial and error the wrappers are very flexible and easy to use. An example of the markup needed for nCards.
