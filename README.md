## Introduction
A restructured HTML template based on the Google Cloud Platform design style. This was done by obtaining Googles CSS code and going through the process of deobfuscating it, then creating a complete package of AngularJS transcluding elements of the complicated Google elements, into an easy to work with HTML template.
